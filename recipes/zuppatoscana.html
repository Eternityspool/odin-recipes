    Nothing warms better than a bowl of Zuppa Toscana, a hearty italian soup comprised of potato, sausage, kale, and spices.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>6oz Bacon</li>
        <li>1lb Italian Sausage</li>
        <li>1 Head Garlic - 8-10 cloves</li>
        <li>1 Medium Onion</li>
        <li>4 Cups Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>5 Medium Russet Potatoes</li>
        <li>1 Kale Bundle - 3-4 large leaves</li>
        <li>1 Cup Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>1 Cup Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or dutch oven, over medium-high heat, add chopped bacon and sauté until browned (5-7 mins). Remove bacon to a paper-towel lined plate and spoon out excess oil, leaving about 1 Tbsp oil in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add Italian sausage, breaking it up with your spatula and sauté until cooked through (5 min). Remove to paper towel lined plate.</li>
        <li>Finely dice onion and add to the pot. Saute 5 min or until soft and golden then add minced garlic and saute 1 min.</li>
        <li>Add 4 cups broth and 6 cups water, and bring to boil. Add sliced potatoes and cook 13-14 min or until easily pierced with a fork.</li>
        <li>When potatoes nearly done, add chopped kale and cooked sausage and bring everything to a light boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 cup cream and bring to boil. Season to taste with salt and black pepper then remove from heat. Garnish with bacon and grated parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
