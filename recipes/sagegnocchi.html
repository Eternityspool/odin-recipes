    Decadent browned butter sauce and pillowy gnocchi combine with the subtle taste of sage for a perfect winter lunch.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Potato Gnocchi</li>
        <li>3tbs Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>18 Fresh Sage Leaves</li>
        <li>1tsp Finely Grated Lemon Zest</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Add about one-third of the gnocchi. To get the gnocchi into the boiling water, fold the parchment ends to form a chute and gently shake the gnocchi out, taking care not to clump them together as you drop them in.</li>
        <li>Give one gentle stir, wait until the gnocchi all float to the surface of the water, and then cook them for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 Tbs. of the butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter is completely melted, use a large slotted spoon or a strainer to transfer the cooked gnocchi from the boiling water to the skillet, shaking off as much water as possible first.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. salt and cook, shaking the pan occasionally to turn the gnocchi, until theyâ€™re lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi.</li>
        <li>Wipe the skillet clean if necessary. Put it over medium-high heat and add the butter. When the butter has almost completely melted, stir in the sage leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns a light brown color (be careful not to let it burn) and the sage leaves darken and crisp up slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved gnocchi and the lemon zest to the pan and toss to coat well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.</li>
